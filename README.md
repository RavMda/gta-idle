# GTA-AFK

GTA-AFK is a simple and dumb tool that will help you stay on the GTA Online server without being kicked for inactivity.

## How it works?

It simulates your mouse scroll when you're focused on GTA window.

Be aware that it does not affect the game in any way and cannot be detected by anti-cheat.

**You can't use it if the window is unfocused**

## Usage

Download any version you prefer [here](https://github.com/RavMda/gta-afk/releases) and just run it.
